# TODO List Challenge


This project is a REST API for managing a to-do list system. The backend was developed using Golang, Gorm, Fiber and PostgreSQL as the database.

## Prerequisites

- [Golang](https://go.dev/) installed.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

## Project Setup

1. **Build and run the application using Docker:**

 ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
  ```
  
  ## Usage

Once the server is set up and running, the API will be available to receive requests from the frontend. You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the endpoints.
